# basic-statis-level-1
In this project, we applied basic statistical concepts to analyze a given dataset and understand its underlying patterns. The study focuses on key measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and data distribution. These measures help summarize the data and identify trends, variability, and relationships within the dataset.
